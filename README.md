# Frontend Mentor - QR Code Component Solution
This is my solution to the QR Code Component challenge on Frontend Mentor.  

The goal of this project was to build a simple, responsive card layout using basic HTML and CSS.

## Overview
A small UI component that displays a QR code with a title and description.  

The layout is centered and works well on mobile and desktop screens.
